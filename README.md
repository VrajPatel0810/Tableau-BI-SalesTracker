# 📊 Sales Insights Dashboard (SQL + Tableau)

This repository showcases a 2-phase real-world Business Intelligence (BI) project where I designed, developed, and iteratively improved Tableau dashboards based on stakeholder feedback. The project demonstrates strong technical, analytical, and storytelling skills using **MySQL**, **SQL**, and **Tableau**.



## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to analyze and visualize a company's sales performance using structured transactional data. The insights support strategic decisions by providing both high-level KPIs and granular, actionable metrics.

The project was executed in **two phases**:



## 🟦 Phase 1: Revenue Dashboard – Executive Overview

📌 Objective: Provide leadership with a clear snapshot of sales metrics across time, region, and currency.

**Key Features:**

* Monthly revenue trends (line chart)
* Market-wise revenue comparison
* Currency-wise breakdown (INR/USD)
* Dynamic filters for year, region, and market
* Clean UI for executive consumption

**Tools Used:**

* MySQL for querying structured sales data
* Tableau for visual exploration and dashboarding
* SQL joins between `transactions`, `date`, and `customers` tables



## 🟧 Phase 2: Profit Dashboard – Stakeholder-Driven Design

📌 Objective: After the initial review, stakeholders requested deeper insights into **profitability** and **product-level performance**.

**Enhancements Introduced:**

* Profit and Profit Margin calculations (custom Tableau fields)
* Top-performing products by profit
* Region-wise profit visualization
* Monthly profitability trends
* Improved UX based on stakeholder input

**Focus:** Drill-down analysis and ROI-centric storytelling



## ✅ Results

* 📊 Built two polished, interactive dashboards ready for real-world deployment
* 🔄 Simulated the analyst-stakeholder feedback loop
* 🧠 Developed critical BI skills: SQL querying, Tableau dashboarding, stakeholder collaboration
* 🎯 Empowered business users to derive both strategic and operational insights
